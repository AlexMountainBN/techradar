# What is it ?
Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables the rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It is free and open-source, has a thriving and active community, excellent documentation, and many free and paid-for support options.
