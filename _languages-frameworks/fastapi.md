# What is it?


FastAPI is a Python web framework for building APIs with a focus on performance, model validation and automatic documentation generation. It is built on top of many other frameworks (such as [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) and [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)), leveraging their strengths to provide a complete solution for API development.

This framework makes it possible to design a OpenAPI specification using a code-first approach: by implementing endpoints and models, it will automatically generate an OpenAPI specification, served by [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) or [ReDoc](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/). It is also possible to add authentication validation using common schemes such as basic authentication, API keys or JWTs, and this is automatically reflected in the API specification.
