# What is it ?
Micro Frontend is a Microservice Testing approach to front-end web development. The current trend is to build a robust and feature-rich web application that resides on top of a Microservice architecture. Over time the Micro Frontend Architecture becomes a part of the application. Often it is developed by a separate team, grows, and gets more challenging to maintain. This type of application is called Frontend Monolith.
