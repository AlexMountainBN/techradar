# What is it ?
GitOps is a technique for implementing Continous Integration and Delivery (CICD) processes in a cloud native environment.
The main idea behind GitOps is to have a Git repository with all your infrastructure defined as code in a declarative way which will provide to the team that is reading the code what is the **desired state** for the infrastructure.
